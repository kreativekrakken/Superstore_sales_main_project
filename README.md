# Superstore_sales_main_project
This is a data analysis of a publicly available dataset on Kaggle.
I have analyzed 5 hypotheses and presented their conclusions. These hypotheses are as follows:-
Hypothesis 1: Technology products have the highest profit margin compared to other categories.
Hypothesis 2: The East region has the highest sales compared to other regions.
Hypothesis 3: Sales are higher during certain months of the year.
Hypothesis 4: Orders with same-day shipping have the lowest rate of returned products.
Hypothesis 5: The company profits are more on weekdays than on weekends.
I have explored a bit further and **recommended how to advertise in order to potentially boost sales.**
